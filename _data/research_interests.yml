  text: "Gene and genome duplication events are important drivers of molecular novelty and adaptation. However these duplications can also be very traumatic on a molecular and cellular level, incurring significant fitness costs. I am interested in exploring how these initial disadvantages to duplication are overcome, as well as how duplication events contribute to animal evolution as a whole."

  text: "High-throughput sequencing is quickly becoming cheaper and easier to use than ever before. In spite of this, most research efforts are concentrated to just a small number of model organisms. I am interested in computational methods which seek to understand non-model genomes, as well as assess how overreliance on models may be biasing current methods. Interests include: gene annotation, homology inference, tree-building, and comparative phylogenetic methods. "

  text: "“Marine Invertebrate” is a term regularly used to refer to a diverse assemblage of animals with representatives from 32 of the 35 commonly recognized animal phyla. Despite containing most of the morphological and phylogenetic diversity within animals, marine invertebrates represent just a small fraction of molecular studies. I am interested in studying evolutionary patterns along these branches on the tree of life which have historically been overlooked."
