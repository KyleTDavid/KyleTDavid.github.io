  text: "The rapid acceleration of both computer processing power and DNA sequencing technology have resulted in a proliferation of large-scale phylogenomic datasets. I seek to harness these data to discover evolutionary patterns and processes by exploring relationships between genotype, phenotype, and environment across the tree of life."

  text: "Despite being a computational biologist at heart, I have also been fortunate enough to conduct field research around the globe, from the Gal√°pagos Islands to the Antarctic Circle. I am interested in exploring how biological phenomena such as speciation, extinction, and genome duplication are distributed across earth and how they contribute to the vast disparities between latitudes we observe today."

  text: "DNA sequencing is becoming cheaper and easier to use than ever before. In spite of this, most research efforts are concentrated to just a small number of model organisms. I am interested in computational methods which seek to understand non-model genomes, as well as employ phylogenetic comparative methods to assess how overreliance on model organisms biases our understanding of evolution and biodiversity."
